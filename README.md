TBD:
 - Get a picture of a guy coding for the product development page
 - Let people contact us through the contact form
 - Post an address and a group contact email
 - Add second slide to slideshow
 - Check the Hyperion template for additional sources (in rack file but not linked in the website itself.)
 - Configure MX records?  (not sure if that needs to happen)
