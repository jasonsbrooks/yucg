Users upload pictures of themselves, tag their items (ie. shirt, pants, dress) and invite friends to view what they have and request to borrow items (if given them access to do so). By the end of 2013, Modabound intends to incorporate peer-to-peer sales.

                    YUCG helped Modabound decide the best marketing strategy at Yale (based on Modabound’s suggested Campus Rep Program) and execute this action plan. Specifically, YUCG helped Modabound acquire more members, engage users through social media, and develop the Modabound brand by fine-tuning the user experience and spreading their message to audiences.</span>
